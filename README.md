Code and tools to generate and analyze theoretical fitness landscapes (NK model, House of Cards model, Rough Mountain Fuji model).

# Theoretical Fitness Landscapes

This repository provides Python code to generate and analyze theoretical fitness landscapes, including:
- **NK Model**: Generates landscapes with tunable ruggedness using parameter K.
- **House of Cards Model**: Completely random fitness assignments for genotypes.
- **Rough Mountain Fuji Model**: A combination of a smooth gradient and random noise.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangli-evo/theoretical-fitness-landscapes.git
